# cuda_h264_decode
Created as a self-reference for h264 decoding on NVIDIA GPUs using the NVCUVID API.

This branch has the working code. My apologies for the mess of a repository, I created this primarily as a learning exercise and wanted to make it public for anyone running into my same frustration.
