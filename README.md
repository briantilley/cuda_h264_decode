# cuda_h264_decode
Created as a self-reference for h264 decoding on NVIDIA GPUs using the NVCUVID API.

This code was written on, for, and run by a PC running Ubuntu 14.04 with cuda toolkit 6.5, and Nvidia driver 346.47.
Video input for this application is provided by a Logitech C920.

This code is provided as possible assistance to those looking to implement any of the features I have used, and it is guaranteed to be ugly and written with horrible code practice.
I'd be happy to offer amateur advice to anyone struggling with these APIs. I do not claim to be an expert, but I'll help where I can.

Code has been cleaned up, latest working version is in master.
